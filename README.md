# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Lab Practicals

This repository contains the lab assignments and practicals completed as part of my **Machine Learning** course during **B.Tech CSE (AI & Analytics)**.

---

## ðŸ“š List of Practicals 

### 1.Data Preprocessing
**Aim**:  
To download any dataset from UCI, Data.org, or other repositories and perform basic data preprocessing tasks using Python or R (handling missing values, encoding, normalization, etc.).

---

### 2. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
**Aim:**
Download the any dataset from UCI or Data.org or from any other data repositories and Implement Single and multilayer perceptron on a dataset.

---

### 3. Bayesian Classifier  
**Aim**:  
To develop and evaluate a Bayesian Classifier using any dataset and assess its classification accuracy.

---

### 4. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
**Aim**:  
To implement PCA using the inbuilt Breast Cancer dataset from scikit-learn in order to reduce the dimensionality of the data and visualize key components.

---
### 5. Linear Regression 
**Aim**:
Prepare the Correlated dataset of your own example or Download the any one of the UCI ML data Set in which find the correlated data and Find the best 
fit line for the data

---
### 6. Decision Tree Classifier/Regressor  
**Aim**:
To implement a Decision Tree Classifier or Regressor on a given dataset and use the trained model to make predictions for specific queries.

---

### 7. Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
**Aim**:  
To implement an SVM Classifier or Regressor using a dataset and evaluate the model using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

---

### 8. K-Means Clustering  
**Aim**:  
To implement the K-Means clustering algorithm on multidimensional data, visualize clusters, and interpret the grouping of data points.

---

### 9. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
**Aim**:  
To implement the KNN algorithm on dataset, compute performance metrics, and compare error rates across different values of K.

---

### 10. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) â€“ MNIST Dataset  
**Aim**:  
To implement a Convolutional Neural Network using TensorFlow/Keras on the MNIST digit dataset and evaluate its accuracy on handwritten digit recognition.

---

### 11. Basic Image Processing with OpenCV  
**Aim**:  
To perform basic image processing operations such as image reading, displaying, resizing, grayscale conversion, and filtering using the OpenCV library.
