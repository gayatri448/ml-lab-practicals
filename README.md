## ðŸ“š List of Practicals 

### 1. Basic Data Preprocessing
**Aim**:  
To download any dataset from UCI, Data.org, or other repositories and perform basic data preprocessing tasks using Python or R (handling missing values, encoding, normalization, etc.).

---

### 2. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
#### a. MLP Classifier Implementation  
**Aim**:  
To implement a Single and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP Classifier) using scikit-learn and generate classification reports including confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.

#### b. MLP Regressor Implementation  
**Aim**:  
To implement a Multi-Layer Perceptron Regressor, train it on a suitable dataset, and display the loss graph over epochs to analyze training performance.

---

### 3. Bayesian Classifier  
**Aim**:  
To develop and evaluate a Bayesian Classifier using the IRIS dataset and assess its classification accuracy.

---

### 4. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
**Aim**:  
To implement PCA using the inbuilt Breast Cancer dataset from scikit-learn in order to reduce the dimensionality of the data and visualize key components.

---

### 5. Decision Tree Classifier/Regressor  
**Aim**:  
To implement a Decision Tree Classifier or Regressor on a given dataset and use the trained model to make predictions for specific queries.

---

### 6. Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
**Aim**:  
To implement an SVM Classifier or Regressor using a dataset and evaluate the model using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

---

### 7. K-Means Clustering  
**Aim**:  
To implement the K-Means clustering algorithm on multidimensional data, visualize clusters, and interpret the grouping of data points.

---

### 8. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
**Aim**:  
To implement the KNN algorithm to classify plants in the IRIS dataset, compute performance metrics, and compare error rates across different values of K.

---

### 9. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) â€“ MNIST Dataset  
**Aim**:  
To implement a Convolutional Neural Network using TensorFlow/Keras on the MNIST digit dataset and evaluate its accuracy on handwritten digit recognition.

---

### 10. Basic Image Processing with OpenCV  
**Aim**:  
To perform basic image processing operations such as image reading, displaying, resizing, grayscale conversion, and filtering using the OpenCV library.
